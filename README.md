## GUI Code
GUI Code is in a separate repository on my github profile here is a link to it **[GUI Code using QT repository](https://github.com/MonerMo/QT-GUI-Interface-for-OLED-Screen-RTC-Interfacing-Project)** 

## This Project was inspired from the small and minimal desktop cubes that tell you the time and play music for you. I was Inpired to make this project on AVR-ATmega32 micro-controller and have the following functionalities :
1) Real Time Clock and Clock Adjustments.
2) Study Timer for Studying Sessions.
3) Digital ON/OFF control for Desk Lamp.
